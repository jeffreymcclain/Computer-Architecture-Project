CSUEB, Computer Architecture

Requires LogicWorks 5.6: https://designworkssolutions.com/logicworks-5-windows/

For our Computer Architecture final project (FinalProject.cct), my partner and I used our knowledge of digital logic and an interactive circuit design tool (LogicWorks) to create a functional simulation of the 3-stage MIPS processor. FinalProject.cct combines the many smaller circuits that make up the MIPS processor.
