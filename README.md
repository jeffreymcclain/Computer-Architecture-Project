About MIPS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture

For our Computer Architecture final project (FinalProject.cct), my partner and I used our knowledge of digital logic and an interactive circuit design tool (LogicWorks) to create a functional simulation of the 3-stage MIPS processor. FinalProject.cct combines the many smaller circuits that make up the MIPS processor.
